### cobalt-clicker ([install](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matteosandrin/userscripts/main/cobalt-clicker.user.js))

The Cobalt platform is used by many employers to manage the immigration journey of their employees. To access Cobalt so you have to go to a third party page, click a button, and then land on Cobalt. This userscript is triggered anytime the third-party page ([gadeloitte.com](gadeloitte.com)) is visited, clicks the button labeled "Enter you immigration details", and then closes the orignal, now useless tab.
