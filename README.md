# Matteo's Userscripts

To run any of the scripts in this repository, you will need to install a userscript browser extension. [Tampermonkey](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) is the extension that I personally use and recommend.

## cobalt-clicker ([install](https://greasyfork.org/scripts/465459-cobalt-clicker/code/cobalt-clicker.user.js))

The Cobalt platform is utilized by employers to manage their employees' immigration process. To access Cobalt, users typically navigate to a third-party SSO page and click a button that redirects them to the Cobalt site. This userscript streamlines the process by automating the sequence. Specifically, when the user visits [gadeloitte.com](gadeloitte.com), the script automatically clicks the button labeled "Enter your immigration details", opens a new tab, and closes the original tab.
